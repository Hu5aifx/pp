        <h3>üôè Sincerity & Faith</h3>
        <p>Dad, I want to be completely honest with you because I know that Allah is always watching over me. Allah says in the Quran:<span class="highlight">"He knows what enters the earth and what comes out of it, and what descends from the sky and what ascends therein. And He is with you wherever you are. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing." (Surah Al-Hadid 57:4)</span> This reminds me that I cannot lie about my intentions because Allah knows my heart and the truth behind my actions. That‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt say that I absolutely need this PC right now, or even in my future life, but I do need an upgraded laptop, which would cost around 102k. If you could extend the budget to 200k, I could get a super powerful PC that would be an incredible long-term investment.</p>
        <p>I feel like if I wanted, I could have lied to you and convinced you easily, but I know that Allah is watching, and I would never cheat you because you have not raised me that way. You‚Äôve taught me to be honest, and I want to stay true to that.</p>
        <p>Although I don‚Äôt urgently require this powerful PC at the moment, I know that having it will be a source of motivation for me. It will push me to focus harder on my goals and allow me to pursue my studies and freelance work with greater dedication. It will also enable me to work more efficiently, especially with my coding and development projects, and help me expand my skills in ways I currently cannot. The ability to work without performance limitations will give me the freedom to explore my full potential.

I understand that this is a significant request, and I truly appreciate your consideration. If you decide to get it for me, I will be forever grateful. Your support would mean so much, not just because of the PC itself, but because of the trust you place in me. I promise I won‚Äôt let you down‚ÄîI will use it responsibly and productively, always keeping Allah in my heart as I strive for success.</p>
